PREFAOE.

Ir has been thought desirable to adopt 101 the present
edition of the Aeneid a standard text, and to adhere to it
throughout, without any variation, even in those few pas·
sagas where the editor might prefer a change 01 reading.
Accordingly the revised text of Jahn, as one 01 the most
· faultless and reliable, and as the one at present, perhaps,
most generally approved, hasbeen carefully reprinted
from the German edition, as the basis of the school conr·
mentary herc offered to the American student.

The notes have been derived from most of the ablest
commentatore 011 the Aeneid, and more especially from
Heyne, Wagner, Thiel, and Forhiger. The editor has
also frequently consulted the numerous school and col·
lege editions, and is particularly indebted to the admira-
ble commentarios 01 Theodora Ladewig 61111 Α. Η. Bryce,
recently published, the former in Berlin, and the latter in
London and Glasgow.

To meet the wants of American studente, very 116-
quent references ars made in the notes, especially in the
earlier part 01 the work, to norw edition 01 Andrews
and Stoddard’s Latin Grammar, andro Dr. Anthon’s edi-
tion 01 Zumpt's Latin Gramma References are also
