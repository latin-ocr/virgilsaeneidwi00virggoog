BOOK SEOOND.

Aeneas recounts to Dido the capture und sack oi
Troy.

1-2ss.'Anerabnef1ntrouuenon Aeneas enters upon his narrative, which begins
with the story oi the wooden horse. The Greeks, now in the tenth year ot the siege,
disheartened by their iil success, resort to stratagem. On the night which precedes
tho burniug ot the city, they pretend ιο give over the siege, and ιο take ship sor their
homes; leaving upon the plain, before the walls oi Troy, an immense movabIe fabric
of wood, made ιο resemble a horse, and ot such sizo that it can bo carried into the city
only by eularging the gato, or breaking down a portion oi the wall.

Within this fabrio are coneeaied many oi the Grecian chiesa, while the army, under
the command ct Agamemnon, instead oi continuing the voyage, is lun-king behind tho
island ot Tenedos, a few miles from Troy.

The TroJan multitude issues from the gates, and, gatheriug round tha strange
image, hositste whether to convey it into the city, or ιο destroy it.

At this moment the cunning Sinon, who has purposaiy suffered himselito bo msdc
prisoner, is brought before king Priam, und by his artful story gains the oonddenee oi
the king, und leads him and his people ιο believe that the wooden horse, once placed
within the eitadei, will become, like the Palladium, the safeguard of Troy. The ds-
vice oi Sinon and the Greeks is eided by Minerva, who sends two serpeuts ιο siey the
priest Laocoon for attempting to destroythe image consecrated to her. This prodigy
condrms the Trojuns in thepurpose alreadyformed,und by means ofropes audrollers
they convey the wooden horse through the city to the citadeI.
