who happened to he at that time returning from Asia Minor
to Italy. Virgil was easily persuaded by his friend and patron
to return with him immediately to Rome, which, however, he
was not destined again to see. His malady had continnally
increased during the voyage, 0οᾶ 0 fcw days alter lauding at
Brundusium he expired. His death occurred in n. 0. 19. His
remains were conveyed from Brundusium to Naples, 0οᾶ
buried on the hill of Posilippo, in the tomb still preserved and
revered as the “ tomb 01 Virgil.”

It is said that Virgil, a short time before his death, desired
to burn up his Aeneid, in consequence 01 the imperfect state
in which it would necessarily be 1011. But being dissuaded
from this purpose by his friends, Tucca and Varius, he direct
ed them in his will to strike out all the verses which were in-
completa, but to add nothing. It does not appear, however,
that any thing was erased by them, unless we admit the ac·
count 01 some 01 the grammarians, who alleged that Tucca 0οᾶ
Varius rejected the four verses, Illa apo, etc, commonly
placed at the beginning, and the passage oct-588 in the sec
ond hook

The Aeneid, though thus 1011 unfinished, and though liable
to the charge of close imitation 01 Homer in many passages,
aud 01 borrowing not a little from earlier Roman poets, has
novertheless always been, aud always will be considered one
01 the noblest poems 01 antiquity.

Virgil found some difficulty in making the calm excellences
01 goodness and piety, with which he wished to' characterize
¹his most prominent personage, appear heroic and striking; and,

, like Milton, he has from the necessity 01 the case suffered the
fur-y and unbridled passion 01 some 01 his characters to make
Ι amore lively and enduring impression than the central per-

sonage os his poem. For it must be admitted that the Turnus ¹

of the Aeneid, and the Satan 01 Paradise Lost, take a more
powcrful hold upon our imaginaticns, 0οᾶ come nearer to
Homer’s conception of ahero, than the calm majesty 01 Μ11-

tor's Saviour, or thc patient suffering and religione obedienoe
01 Virgil’s Aeneas.
