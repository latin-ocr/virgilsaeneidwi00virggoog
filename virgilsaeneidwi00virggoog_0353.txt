movet—ast. liuhap in italy. See note on Italian, 2.-264. Maree-
pouet3 he shall establieh lewa (mores), and a city (mnia) sor hia people (vi-
ris). Ponere is used alike with mores (or tepea), and with moenie. Mores,
is here constitution, or cive organisation, and lawa. Gomp. vi. 852, viii. 316.
Some understand by viria the conquercd people, the Rntvla' and Etrusci, or
seroces popvlos, mentioned in 268. But we have salamantinae leger viria,
said of Dido and her oron people, where viria stands precisely in the same
relation to the queen as the same word here to Aeneae—eat, aas. He
shall be engaged in this work of establishing his power (shall reign) three
years, aster having subdued Turnus and the Rutulians. Then (we are to
understand) he shall be taken into heaven. According to some traditione
Aeneas was drcwned in the Numicins; according to others he was alain in
battle, and buried ou the banks of that river. 'This period of three yearsis
expressed here by tertia aenae and terna hiberna, meaning three summere
and three wintere—lleguauiem is not “beginninp hin reign‚” but “continn-
a'ng his reign.” For the distributive numeral in terna hiberna (tempora),
see Gr. g 120, 43 Z. ξ 119. Wanderlich is followed by Thiel and others in
making Rutulis saltatlis the dative after hanainint by a Greek construction.
But whether we take it as a datiye, or as an ablativa absolate, which seems
preferable, the sense is, “ after the subjection of the Rutulians.” Literally,
vntil the third cannen shall have seen hivn reipning, and three wintere shall
have passed away, the Rutiliana having icen aetna—eat. saonen de-
notes the transition to a new idea or new topic, not invenietent with the
foregoing, but merely different from it. Bnt and noro are so used in Eng-
lish. manin, the son of Aeneae and Oreiisa, is accompanying his father
in his wanderinge.—luli. For the dadae case here see Gr. g 204, R. 83
