'LIFE AND WBITINGS Ol* VIRGIL. XV

vas again disturbed by the demands of the veterane, and our
poet in vain, though at tho risk of his life, attempted to main·
tain his rights against the centurion Arrius. Fleeing again
for suocor to Octavian, he was reinstated, though not without
long and anxious delay, iu the possession of his farm.v During
this period of delay and depressing uncertainty, hc wrote the
ninth Eclogue, in which he bewails his unhappy lot. But on
obtaining at length the object of his petition,his joy and grati-
tude found atterance in the beautiful hymn called the fourth
Eclogue, in which he hails the auspicious times just dawning
on the world, and initiated by the consulship of his friend and
patron Pollio. The sixth Eologue was composed in the fol-

Eclogues, the seventh and tenth, were probably composed in
the two following years.

The Eologues established the reputation of the poet, and
gained him at once ardent friends and admirers among the
most powerful and the most cultivated of the Romans.
Among these, besides his early aud fast friend, Pollio, were
Octavian, Maecenas, Varius, Horace, and Propertius. These
and all other educated Romans of the day regarded Virgil as
already superior in many'respects to any poet who had yet
appeared. It was most of all in the exquisite finish and har-
mony of his hexameters that he exoelled all who had preceded
him. The hexameter verse had been first introduced into the
Latin language, at the close of the second Punic war, by the
soldier and poet Ennius. But though distinguished by origi·
nality, strength, and vigor, the poetry of Ennius was ,harsh
and rugged to a degree which rendered it to the more culti-
vated testes of later generations almost intolerable. Nor by
the poets who suoceeded Ennius had any such improvement
been made in the composition of Latin verse, as to admit of
any comparison between them and their Grecian models. It
was reserved for two great poets ofRome, two congenial spirits,
