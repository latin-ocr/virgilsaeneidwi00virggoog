(which isbetter authenticeted here then Detopeam, given in some editions), is
put by attractiva in the caso 01 the relative quae, instead of the accusative,
which would have been the regular construction. See Gr. 5 206, (6) (b).
Quarum is translated here as earumqtu; the relative is a closer end ueater
connective than aad with a demonstrative or persanat pronoun, which, how·
ever, the English idiom often requires instead 01 the Latin relative. See
Arnold's Lat. Prore Gomp, 5 61, 536; Gr. 5 206, (11). This preference
for the relative iu Latin often gives riso to the construction, which we have
here, of two relatives or interrogatives iu the same sentence; as, (110. Brut.
