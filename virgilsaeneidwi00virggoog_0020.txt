agriculture, science,and letters. The Sicilian Greek, Theocri-
tus, was at this time his favorite author, audit was from him
that the general plan, though not the individual character, of
the Bucolics was derived.

The minor poems, such as the Culex, Giris, dre, which
have been appended to the worhs of Virgil, and which are
sometimes reokoned among his earlier productions, are as·

eribed to him on very insufficient grounds. The Eologues
were commenced about n o. 42, attha request of Ο. Asinius
Pollio, who was then aeting as the lieutenant of Antouy in
Gaul. Pollio was himself distinguished as a poet, and not less
as a scholar, orator, and historian. Under his patronage the
Eelogues numbered in the present arrangement 2, 3, and 5,
had already been written, when the literary labors and the
peaeeful life of the poet were suddenly interrupted. The
veteran legions of Octavian, on returning from Phihppi, and
demanding the allotments of land which had been promised
them as a reward for their services in the civil war, were
authorized to take possession of eighteen Italian sities, with
the district of country pertaining to each. The cities thus
treated were 'those which had espoused the side of Brutus;
for this the unhappy occupants of the adjacent country were
thread to give up their hereditary estates to the rapacious
soldiery. As the landa of Cremona, which was one of the¹
condemned cities, were not sufficient to satisfy the legion·
ariasto whom they had heen assigned, they took violent
possession also ofa part of the country belonging to the
neighboring city of Mantua. Virgil, whose sarm was in this
district, and was thus endangered, had recourse at first to
Pollio, and foratime was secure rmder his protectior. But
when that commender, in n. o. 41, marohed with his troops
to the aid of L. Antonius in the Perusian war, Virgil was
compelled to seek relies from Octavian in person, audior this
purpose visited Rome. It was the kind reception given him
by the emperor on this occasion which inspired the grateful
and glowing eulogy contained in the first Eclogue.
