sources 01 their noble language‚ and to make it flow both in
heroic and lyric verse with all the grace and dignity which
had hitherto been characteristic 01 the Greek alone.

Aser the publication 01 the Eclogues, Virgil appears to
have passed the remaindcr 01 his life chiefly at N aples. His
feeble health was probably the occasion 01 this. ·

It was bere that he composed the Georgica, a didactic
poem in four books, in which he endeavors to recall the Ital-
