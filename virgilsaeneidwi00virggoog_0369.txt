Rhesus, a Thracian prince, who had come to the aid of Priam, and encamped
on the night of his arrival outside of the city. It was fated that Troy
should not fall unless the horses of Rhesus should come lnto the possession
of the Greeks before they had tested os the pasturage of Troy, and dmnk
ol* the river Xanthus. In tho 11. x. 433, Ulysses and Diomed penetrate into
the camp of Rhesus on this first night of his arrival, slay the chief himself,
and twelve of his followcrs, and convey the horsea to the Grecian camp.

The poet employs the language of his own day, and the painter takes a simi-
lar deense—lili· Prlmo promta somno. Translate literally: betrayed by
the first sleep, i. e. by the sleep of the first night, or during the hours of
sleep on the first night aiter his arrival. This is the obvious meaning,
though many take primo umnec in the sense of the first port, or the earliest,
aud so deepeet, port of slumber. But the passage of the Iliad in the lOth
Book, which Virgil here had in mind, by no means justifies the idea that
Rhesus was elain in the early hours of the night, or of sleep—lul. Vasta·

ally engaged in slaughter, but the bodies of the elain, scattered around in
