But whatever defecta there may be in the Aeneid, it is re·
plete with all the qualities which are essential to a great work
os art. Itis great in conception and invention. It is won-
derfully diversified in soenes, incidente, and characters, while
it never departs from the vital principle of unity. It is
adorned with the finest diction and imagery of which lan-
guage is capable. In discoursing of great aohievements and
great events, it never comes short of the grandeur which be-
fits tha epic style3 in passages of sorrow and suffering it takes
hold of our sympathies with all the power of the most heart-
rending tragedy. What a sublime epio of itself is the account
of the sack of Troyl what a tragedy of passion and fate is
presented in the death of Dido! Indee'd the student will find
in the Aeneid many dramatio scenas, many vivid picturas of
life and manners, many lively narratives of adventure, any one
oi which would be of itself a poem, and would secure to its
author an enviable fame.

Of the praeminent worth ot' Virgil's poems, and of their
importanoe as literary studies, the most striking proof is pre·
sented in the fact that so many of the classios of modern
poetry, in all cultivated languages, have manifestly been pro·
duced under the moulding and refining influenoe of this great
master of thoart. Dante, who felt all the power of “the
Mantuan,” ascribes to him whatever excellence he has himself
attained in beauty of style3 and, in the generous avowal of
his indebtedness, he utters one of the noblest eulogias ever
bestowed by any poet upon a brother poet.

Oh delli altri poeti onore alume!
ngliami ’l lungo studio, e ll grande amore,
che mi han fatto carcar lo tuo volume!
Tu sei lo mio meestro e il mio autore;
'lu sel solo colui, da cu’ io tolsi
Lo bello stile, che mi a fatto onera*
